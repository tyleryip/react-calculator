# React Calculator

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5c9f1380-514d-450c-9656-2374ede3396a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-ios-calculator-clone/deploys)

## About

I built the React Calculator over a weekend as a personal challenge to get familiar with React 16.8 and the new best practices. I also wanted to get some practice with using Tailwind CSS for styling my components. Throughout the process of developing the React Calculator, I did not follow any tutorials and challenged myself to use only the [React Beta Documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org), the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for troubleshooting bugs. A few other sites were used for researching how a proper 4-function calculator should behave (ex. I didn't know what the percent key did on calculators, it's very handy!). Check it out the live [demo site](https://react-ios-calculator-clone.netlify.app).

## Features

The design of the React Calculator is heavily inspired by the iOS calculator app found on iPhones. It behaves identically to the iOS calculator app!

As a 4-function calculator, it supports:

- [x] Addition
- [x] Subtraction
- [x] Multiplication
- [x] Division
- [x] Percentage
- [x] Decimal numbers
- [x] Clearing
- [ ] Keyboard input support

## Available Scripts

To run the app in the local dev environment, navigate to the `/frontend` directory and run:

```zsh
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To create an optimized build for production settings, run:

```zsh
npm run build
```
